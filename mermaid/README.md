# Mermaid

[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) graphs in the Markdown are automatically rendered into embedded diagrams in markdown files by the github enterprise [GitHubâ€™s HTML pipeline](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/).  This means that embed Mermaid diagrams in a .md file will be converted into a graph when pushed to github.  You can also see how they will be rendered localy using the [Mermaid support for Markdown](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) for VsCode.  


## Resources

- [https://mermaid.live/edit](Online live editor).  Just use the editor then copy and paste it in your mark down file.  I used this tool to get some of the examples below.
- [Mermaid Cheat Sheet](https://jojozhuang.github.io/tutorial/mermaid-cheat-sheet/).  I used this to get some of the examples below.


## Examples

### C4

This is a simple example of the built in C4 support

```mermaid
C4Context
title Physical Infrastructure

    Boundary(bHardware, "Infrastructure", "Physical Infrastructure that is installed in a given site") {
        System(sNode, "Physical Hardware Node", "White box X Server")
        System(sNetwork, "Network", "Cloud Network")
        System(sStorage, "Storage Services", "File, Block, and Object Storage") 
        BiRel(sNode, sNetwork, "")
        BiRel(sNode, sStorage, "")
    }
```



### Flow Chart

The below shows the flow of foo to bar 

```mermaid

flowchart TD
   Foo --> id1(Some process Here) --> Bar
```

And this flow shows Left to Right

```mermaid

graph LR
    A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
    A --> C(Round Rect)
    B --> D{Rhombus}
    C --> D
```

### Schedule

You can use headers as anchors you can deep link to a diagram in github. 

```mermaid
gantt
    title Start Up X
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Desing
    Figure out what it should do   :a1, 2023-02-01, 4d
    Inventory Quality Attributes   :after a1, 3d
    Create Draft Design   :10d
    section Business
    Create Budget    :2023-02-01, 4d
    Get Funding      : 5d

```

Its helpful to add context right in your markdown next to a diagram

```mermaid

sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?
    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
    John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!
    John-->>-Alice: I feel great!

```

### Journey

```mermaid
journey
    title My working day
    section Go to work
      Make tea: 5: Me
      Go upstairs: 3: Me
      Do work: 1: Me, Cat
    section Go home
      Go downstairs: 5: Me
      Sit down: 3: Me
```

### Pie

```mermaid

pie title Pets adopted by volunteers
    "Dogs" : 386
    "Cats" : 85
    "Rats" : 15

```

# Debuging

If there are erros rendering localy or in github it can be useful to render the mermaid diagram localy.  To do that you can use the mmdc app.

```shell
# Mac Instructions 
# TODO: I think docker is a better way to do this.  Maybe both should be documented here?)

# If you dont have brew installed go get it. https://brew.sh/
# Then install npm (Node Package Manager) if you dont have that.
brew install npm

# Use npm to install the mermaid cli
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

# Use the mermaid cli to process the diagram.  It will output a svg and a new markdown file that 
# will contain a link to the svg via an image.  Read about it here: https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
mmdc -i domain_view.md -o domain_view_out.md

# TODO: Windows instructions?  If you want them feel free to contribute.  :)
```
